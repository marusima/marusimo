This repository contains my personal portfolio website, where I’m experimenting with web development and learning the fundamentals of coding. 
With guidance from experienced peers, I’m exploring new concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also expanding my skills in Python and Java.

This project is a reflection of my curiosity and determination to grow in the field of IT. It’s not just a portfolio—it's a showcase of my journey into programming and design.
